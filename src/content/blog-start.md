I've started this blog to keep track of my personal projects and work (mis)adventures.
What I'd like to accomplish by writing this blog (and hosting it on a static site):

1. Securing snapshots of my memories across multiple facets of experience
2. Keeping a persistent journal somewhere for introspection/reflection 
3. Playing around with some js (I work mainly on the backend at my job currently)

I'd like to host my own site one day with extra features:

- minigames
- memory explorer (hopefully using a graph backend somehow)
- comments
