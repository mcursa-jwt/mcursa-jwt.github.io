I'm trying to personalise this site a bit more - at this point i'm still learning html/css/js. <br><br>
My friend edgar and I had briefly played around with a (https://github.com/mcursa-jwt/conwaylife) js implementation of [conways game of life](https://youtu.be/ouipbDkwHWA), and i'm hoping to have that be an interactive part of this site.
<br><br>
I remember being new to web development at that point, and it was at that time when I first learnt about conwaylife too. It was way more fun than writing ajax calls and jquery. You could create `Life.`
<br><br>
There's also the [stochastic conways game of life](https://youtu.be/4dNwIjJCRz0) which has added "chaos", a probability that it changes regardless of neighbouring cell states (ref: [Thermodynamics in Stochastic Conwayâ€™s Game of Life](https://www.mdpi.com/2410-3896/8/2/47#sec2-condensedmatter-08-00047)). can't tell the difference now but i'm sure implementing it will make it clearer :D
